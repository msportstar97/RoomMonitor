<p>
Welcome to RoomMonitor! <br><br>

The application that will help you, the user, better understand the status of the rooms in your building.
After installing units in the doorways leading into and out of your rooms,
RoomMonitor will be able to display, using this website, data such as the number of people in a room, the temperature of that room, and the humidity.
Other data can also be possible with additional sensors.
This data can be viewed overtime and will be stored in a database within the ARTIK Cloud, a Samsung IoT Cloud service.
Using this website, you will be able to easily access this stored data without the unnecessary step of logging into the ARTIK Cloud.
By simply navigating to this website, you will be able to make adjustments to your building that can help lower energy costs and save you money! <br>
